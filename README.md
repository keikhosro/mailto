   - **CC** - Carbon copy recipients (comma-separated)
   - **BCC** - Blind carbon copy recipients (comma-separated)

#### Using Tokens in Subject and Body
The extension supports two dynamic tokens that will be replaced with actual page information:

- **{PAGE_TITLE}** - Replaced with the current page's title
- **{PAGE_URL}** - Replaced with the current page's URL

**Example Subject Templates:**
```
Check out: {PAGE_TITLE}
Found this interesting: {PAGE_TITLE}
{PAGE_TITLE} - Thought you might like this
```

**Example Body Templates:**
```
I found this page and thought of you:

{PAGE_TITLE}
{PAGE_URL}

Let me know what you think!
```

```
Take a look at this article: {PAGE_TITLE}

Link: {PAGE_URL}
```

#### Inserting Tokens
When editing the Subject or Body fields in the options page:
1. Click the "Insert {PAGE_TITLE}" or "Insert {PAGE_URL}" buttons
2. The token will be inserted at your cursor position
3. You can manually type the tokens as well

#### Default Behavior
- If Subject is left blank, the page title will be used
- If Body is left blank, only the page URL will be used
- If no tokens are used, the text will be sent as-is

### Button Behavior Options

Choose what happens when you click the extension icon:
1. **Email without default recipient** - Opens blank email with templates but no TO address
2. **Email to default recipient** - Pre-fills all configured recipients and templates

The other option remains available in the right-click context menu.

### Context Menu
Right-click anywhere on a page to access the email sharing options from the context menu.

Body: {PAGE_URL}
```
